The [code_used_to_analyze_data.pdf](https://github.com/dmiller903/PedFam/blob/master/code_used_to_analyze_data.pdf)
file contained in this repository provides the commands and code we used to
process the VCF files analyzed as part of the manuscript, 
"Analysis of three nuclear families with a single pediatric-cancer case using linked-read whole genome sequencing"

The scripts contained within this repository were executed with the docker container
[compound-het-vip](https://hub.docker.com/r/dmill903/compound-het-vip).
Some of the scripts executed were adapted from
[CompoundHetVIP](https://github.com/dmiller903/CompoundHetVIP). The
example
[here](https://github.com/dmiller903/CompoundHetVIP/blob/master/CompoundHetVIP_example.pdf)
explains, in detail, how some of the scripts are used. The publication for
CompoundHetVIP can be found here:
